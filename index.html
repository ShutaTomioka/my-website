            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Originally from Kansai, now living in Tokyo. I graduated from Kobe University in Data
                Science (2025), specializing in aircraft fuel consumption. Currently working at Kao Corporation in the
                data science team, living in Sumida City.</p>

            <p>
                I built this website as a personal project to deepen my knowledge of web development. Currently, I am
                focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project also serves as a creative outlet for
                building a digital space of my own.

                    <h3>Aircraft Fuel Consumption Reduction through Climb Optimization</h3>
                    <p>My graduation thesis at Kobe University focused on verifying the **fuel consumption reduction
                        effect of optimized aircraft climb procedures using actual operational flight data**. I
                        investigated the effectiveness of switching from the traditional VNAV SPD mode (Maximum Climb
                        Thrust) to the V/S (Vertical Speed) mode during the mid-phase of climb, aiming to reduce engine
                        thrust and improve fuel efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Using **four months of test flight data from Lufthansa Cargo's Boeing 777F aircraft**, my study
                        analyzed the impact of external factors such as aircraft weight, outside air temperature (ISA
                        deviation), wind speed, and wind direction on fuel efficiency. I developed Python scripts for
                        **automated data extraction and cleaning**, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.</p>
                    <p>The research demonstrated a potential **fuel saving of approximately 35-40 pounds per flight**
                        compared to conventional methods, aligning with prior simulation-based studies. This approach
                        contributes to both economic savings and a significant reduction in CO2 emissions for airlines.
                        The findings provide practical guidelines for airlines to select optimal climb methods based on
                        specific conditions (e.g., lower temperatures and moderate aircraft weights for 600-4000 ft/min
                        climb method). </p>

                    <h3>AEON NEXT Senko Hanabi Coupon Project</h3>
                    <p>As part of my professional experience, I contributed to the **AEON NEXT "Senko Hanabi Coupon"
                        project**. This initiative aimed to significantly improve last-mile delivery efficiency for
                        AEON's online supermarket "Green Beans". I was responsible for writing the **source code** for
                        this project, which leveraged data science and AI to optimize delivery routes and coupon
                        distribution, demonstrating a practical application of advanced analytics in retail logistics.

                <h1>2025-07-02: For their comfort or health??.</h1>
                <p>I see people who guard elementary school children every day.
                    They are very kind and helpful, but I feel a little sad.
                    When I greet them, they don’t respond—not just to me, but to other adults as well.
                    I wonder why. One of the important things they teach children is to greet everyone they meet.

                    Guarding children is a very important job, and I respect them.
                    But it feels like they only do what they want to do.
                    If they have chosen to take on this role, shouldn’t they also teach children how to interact with
                    society through their own behavior?

                    Right now, it seems like they’re only doing what suits them—for their own comfort or health?

                <h1>2025-07-01: I'll try to do my best.</h1>
                <p>Today is the first day of July. It's very hot and humid.
                    At work, the details of our project are confidential, but I’m the leader of my team.
                    Of course, I’ve been a leader many times during my student life, but in the workplace, there are
                    many new challenges.
                    I’m not sure if I can do it perfectly, but I’ll do my best to contribute to my team — not only by
                    understanding each teammate’s strengths and weaknesses, but also by being aware of my own.
                    To complete the project successfully by the end of the day, I’ll try to manage everything as well as
                    I can.</p>

                <p>
                    Today is the last day of June.
                    It doesn’t really feel like the rainy season (called tsuyu in Japan) these days.
                    I’m not sure why, but I feel like time passes more quickly than before.
                    Maybe it’s just because I’ve been really busy lately — that’s part of it, honestly, but there are
                    also other reasons.
                    I want to live a life where I can enjoy every moment — not just the happy ones, but also the sad and
                    boring ones.
